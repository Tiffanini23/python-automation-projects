Linux Networking
- ip a: Shows your computer's IP addresses and network interfaces. Use this to see if you are actually connected to a network.
-  ping: Tests the connection to a specific website or IP (e.g., ping google.com). It measures how fast data travels. Remember: Press Ctrl+C to stop it.
- curl: Downloads data from the internet or checks if a website is up without a browser. (Example: curl -I google.com to see the site's header).
- nslookup: The "Name Server Lookup." It finds the IP address of a domain name (e.g., it tells you that google.com is actually 142.250.80.46).
- ss: Short for "socket statistics." It shows all the active connections coming into or going out of your computer.
