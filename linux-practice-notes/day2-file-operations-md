## Key Learnings

- Nano is a terminal text editor (no mouse!)
- cat displays entire file contents
- grep searches for text patterns
- cp copies, mv moves/renames, rm deletes (permanently!)
- File permissions show who can read/write/execute

## Files Created

- workspace/members/members-list.txt - List of 5 member names

## Practice Notes

Successfully created and edited a text file using only the terminal. Learned that Linux file deletion is permanent (no trash bin!). Understanding file permissions: rwx = read, write, execute.
